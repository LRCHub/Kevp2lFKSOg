Midnight in June
Moonlight sweeping the room
Song of the loon
Alone here and talking to you
And tonight I can't sleep
The thought keeps on wrestling with me
I want to play with it
Cradle it
Say
Love, come to me
If I am ready
To surrender
I have worked hard
Protecting my heart
And I am tired
Give me a clue
Won't you send me a tune?
Could it be
Things have been changing for me?
And tonight I'll get no rest
A thought is sitting on my chest
I want to play with it
Cradle it
Say
I can tell you
No strawberry moon
Has ever been wasted
If it brought us here
And berries, my dear
They want to be tasted
