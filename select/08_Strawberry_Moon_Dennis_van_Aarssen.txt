Verse 1
Gales, the skies are grey
Ever colder, the winds get bolder
Hails, all night and day
I need to hold her, I never told her
Prechorus
Her smile warms my soul
And tempers the cold
When winter melts into spring
Chorus
The strawberry moon needs no reason
Just shows up in June, kicks off the season
So now's a good time to fall in love
My strawberry moon won't keep me waiting
Always on time, seems like we're dating
And look at her glow
Climb higher and higher
My strawberry moon is on fire
Verse 2
Stars, the skies are clear
Ever brighter, ever lighter
Close, her eyes so near
And I’ll guide her ever tighter
Prechorus
And right there and then our story began
We’ll be back here every year
[Chorus]
