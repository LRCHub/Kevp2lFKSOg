Hello lonesome mind, breakin' free
I do not like the way you treated me
Upon my mountain I...
I look ahead
Feeling grounded with each and every step
Oh, each and every step

A silver moon, she's hanging low tonight
She sits alone, so lonely I could cry

I go swimming, drown out all the noise
I float in solitude, staying is by choice
Well there are times that I'm longin' for you
But you're unattainable and no one else will do
No, no one else will do

Strawberry moon, she pulls me with the tides
Her amber hue, it covers me in light
And as the night rushes into me
I'm letting go of what I do not need
That lonely feeling
The one I cannot breathe in
I'll throw it into the sea and
Let it wash away

The dusk, it comes by the dawn and leaves
Taken with it that heavy part of me
The darkness glows as the light shines through
Carried off by the strawberry moon
Strawberry moon...
