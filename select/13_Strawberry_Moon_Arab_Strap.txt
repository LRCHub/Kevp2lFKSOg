I've fallen yet again for a captivating con
Sucked back into that sad old siren song
I fell in love, I fell away, I fell behind, I fell apart
What can I say? I am not strong
Now I'm not falling on my sword, I'm just falling on my shins
Sweet moonshine, wash away my sins
Big strawberry moon, save my soul
Let my body break, but you stay whole
The city of stairs doesn't want me
I am a ghost with a bottomless cup
I'm not stotious, I'm just hurting
But all I have to do is look up
Big strawberry moon, save my soul
Let my body break, but you stay whole
I have no need of paradise, I have no need to roam
Big strawberry moon, take me home
So throw on your cloak and come down and join me
Witness my struggles firsthand
I'll stay young and handsome, sleep forever in your light
I'll give you daughters, give you sons, we'll form a band
I'm just dressing for the weather and the forecast is for pain
The dark listens to the dark, night fosters night
My ripe, rose love keeps me sane
Big strawberry moon, save my soul
Let my body break, but you stay whole
I have no need of paradise, I have no need to roam
Big strawberry moon, take me home
I see you and you see me
I am bound and broken, you are free
There's grace on the ground and grace in the hall
I see you, you see all
